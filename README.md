TVMLKitchen helps to manage your TVML **with or without additional client-server**.

# Requirements
- Swift3.0
- tvOS 9.0+

Use 0.9.6 for Swift2.2.  
Swift2.3 is not supported. Feel free to send PR.

# What's TVML?
Please refer to [Apple's Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/tvos/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/ATV_Template_Guide/).
It's a markup language which can be used only on tvOS.
TVML makes it easy to build awesome apps for tvOS.

# Why ?

TVML is easy, but TVJS is not really.
With TVMLKitchen, loading a TVML view is in this short.

```
Kitchen.serve(xmlFile: "Catalog.xml")
```

You don't have to write any JavaScript code at all!

Kitchen automatically looks for the xmlFile in your Main Bundle, parse it, then finally pushes it to navigationController.
Please refer to the [Documentation](./Documentation) for more information.
